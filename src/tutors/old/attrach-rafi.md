My name is Rafi and I'm currently in my 3rd year studying Information Systems. Feel free to join even if you're not registered for my group as there are no physical place limitations this semester.

Contact me beforehand though to check if it's not too full as this would negatively impact the interactivity in the session. You can find my contact info on my home page (Click on my name). See you on Wednesdays!
